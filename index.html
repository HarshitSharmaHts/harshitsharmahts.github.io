                    fileCoDoc is a desktop application which works as file copier with assignment creation utility. This tool basically copy all files with same extension on user demand and capable of creating an assignment for C, C++, Java programming language, if you will use this app for assignment than this tool will touch all the c/cpp/java files recursively in source directory (provided by user) and write them in a document and export that document as pdf.

                    This project portrays the use of SONAR in mapping the surroundings with the help of an Ultrasonic sensor and Arduino Uno Board. Bats and Dolphins use SONAR to aid their vision and to move around. The same principle is used by cruise ships to navigate and get readings from deep inside the ocean. The same method of depth perception has been used over here to plot the 2-D graph of the surrounding environment. Active SONAR has been used to get the idea of the distance between the BOT and the surrounding environment.
